NOTE: Whenever I say "GUI froze" this is when I replayed the data right after recording, and it seems like once the car appears (in real life) the MATLAB GUI stops playing.

1. Rear radar detects a right hook happening in front of it. Radar 30 deg counterclockwise.
2. Rear radar detects a right hook happening in front of it. Radar 30 deg clockwise.
3. Same as 2, but moved poosition of radar to better see the turn.
4. Same as 3, but car performed a little stop before fully turning. The data might be faulty.
5. Same orientation and placement as 3, but car goes straight. GUI froze.
6. Redo of 5. GUI again froze.
7. Redo of 6. Even though I had closed programs on my computer I am not using right now, the GUI froze again.
8. Left turn (no collision). Seems like GUI gave faulty results, and froze. Restarting Matlab.
9. Redo of 5. GUI again froze. Going to restart the radar.
10. Redo of 5. GUI again froze. 
11. Going to opposite side of street to simulate front radar. Rotated 30 clockwise from horizontal scan position. Car does right turn. Frozen GUI.
12. Try 11 again. Doesn't seem like the GUI picked anything up...
13. Going straight. GUI freeze? Reflash.
14. Redo of 12. Also moved backwards by about 2 meters. GUI still froze.
15. Back to orientation 2. Right turn. Might not have fronzen.

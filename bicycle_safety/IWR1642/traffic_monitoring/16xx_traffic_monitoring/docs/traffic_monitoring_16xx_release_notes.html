Version 2.3.0
=============

Overview
========

This software package demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to count and track multiple vehicles in a traffic monitoring application. Using the IWR1642, detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the device to localize vehicles and track their movement with a high degree of accuracy. This package includes a max velocity extension algorithm that enables accurate tracking of at least 3x the max velocity as determined by the radar chirp configuration. The lab provides full source code and a CCS project and runs on the TI mmWave sensor xWR16xx EVM.
 
Features
========

The following features are supported:
* Supports mmWave SDK 2.0.0.4
* Supports xWR16xx ES2.0 devices. Please note that xWR16xx ES1.0 devices are not supported in this release. Please refer to SDK 2.0.0.4 release notes for more information.
* tm_play tool for replaying collected data and adjusting group tracking results
* Vmax extension for at least 3x max velocity
* Group tracking algorithm for tracking multiple vehicles across multiple lanes
